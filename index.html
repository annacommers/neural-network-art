  The use and accessibility of machine learning and artificial intelligence has increased greatly over just the past few years. One application of this technology is 
  art. AI art has been used across mediums in performances, visual pieces, music, interactive displays, and more. As AI technology continues to get more advanced, 
  these projects push us to consider how we define art and how artificial intelligence will fit into our future world. For example, Stephanie Dinkins created an 
  interactive talking sculpture with AI trained on oral history from a black American family (Dinkins). The piece is meant to explore the concerns and ideals of 
  communities underrepresented in tech (Dinkins). Another artist, Tom White, used AI to create abstract illustrations that can be reliably classified by neural 
  networks (Tom). This work allows us to see a part of how AI processes images.
