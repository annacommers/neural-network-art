# Neural Network Art

This project allows users to train an autoencoder neural network on virtually any set of images, then use the trained autoencoder to transform a new set of between one and ten images into pieces of art. 

## Usage

It is recommended that the code provided be used in a google colab notebook. The autoencoder relies on the Tensorflow library which is well suited to work in the colab environment. To use the program as is, run the code cell in the notebook `neural-network-art.ipynb`. This will run the `main` function which puts all the classes together. More information on each class is below. In order to train the autoencoder, the `TakeInput` class asks the user for the path to the training images, the name of the training images, and the number of training images. Similarly, to add new images to transform, it asks for a folder path, the name of the images, and the number of images (up to ten). More information on data is below.
